This has the assignment that moshe sent me and the respective solutions
the solutions for parts 2 and 3 are in seperate folders to keep them from being confused
I did most of the work in the interpriter but i have transcribed them into Macros

The "./part3/plotsomevals.C" is the macro that I used to make the plot and the "./part3/someplot.C" is the macro that the canvas saved
